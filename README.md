# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## Project Description
This project explores the implementation and manipulation of binary trees, fundamental data structures in computer science. The tasks involve creating, traversing, and analyzing binary trees using C. The emphasis is on memory management, efficient algorithms, and clean code following the Betty style guidelines
